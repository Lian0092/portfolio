I am sorry that I did not choose a purpose website because I did not design that web page. We only have two website design assignments, so I had to choose this as a prototype. In the web design class, I did not complete the assignment of the personal purpose website, so I I chose another website design. This assignment requires us to redesign a website. I chose this fried chicken website to redesign and help this website become better. So I had to choose the original website’s pictures, even if I don’t have the right To use.
This paragraph is an introduction. This website has five pages, and NAV can lead you to each page. On the footer you can find two buttons, one to bring you back to the top, and one to help you reach Contact us. There are 4 interactive menu buttons in the menu page, which can display different menu foods.
I have been thinking about how to make a menu list when I made a Menu page. I thought about it a lot, but it was a big problem for me. I tried to use 'active' and'display: none; 'to solve the puzzle, but it doesn't work. In the same way, I thought of many ways to modify, I hope to put those pictures into one page, but I have not succeeded. Finally, I decided to create more sub-pages to cooperate with the menu list.
